## 🧩 Project Overview

Your **carbon footprint** is the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by your daily lifestyle.  
This app turns everyday activities (travel, food, power, purchases) into measurable CO₂ values, helping you:
- Understand which habits have the most environmental impact 🌱  
- Track improvements over time 📊  
- Make informed, sustainable choices 🌞  

---

Formula -
Emissions = Activity Amount × Emission Factor
Daily CO₂ = (Total CO₂ of Item) ÷ (Expected Lifetime in Days)

**Total Daily CO₂ = Sum of all categories**
Annual CO₂ = (Daily Total × 365) / 1000  [in tonnes]
